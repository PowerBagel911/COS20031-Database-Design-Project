## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- MySQL/MariaDB database server
- Access to Deepseek API (for SQL assistance feature)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/archery-club-database.git
   cd archery-club-database
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up Streamlit secrets:
   - Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file with the following content:
     ```toml
     # Database Configuration
     DB_HOST = "your-db-host"
     DB_USER = "your-db-user"
     DB_PASSWORD = "your-db-password"
     DB_NAME = "your-db-name"

     # API Keys
     DEEPSEEK_API_KEY = "your-deepseek-api-key"
     ```
   - Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials

4. Initialize the database:
   - Run the SQL scripts in a MySQL/MariaDB client:
     ```bash
     mysql -u yourusername -p yourdatabase < create_tables.sql
     mysql -u yourusername -p yourdatabase < create_procedures.sql
     ```

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Deploying to Streamlit Cloud

1. Push your code to GitHub (without the secrets.toml file, which is in .gitignore)

2. Create a new app in Streamlit Cloud pointing to your repository

3. Add your secrets in the Streamlit Cloud dashboard:
   - Go to your app settings
   - Navigate to the "Secrets" section
   - Add the same configuration from your local secrets.toml file:
     ```toml
     # Database Configuration
     DB_HOST = "your-db-host"
     DB_USER = "your-db-user"
     DB_PASSWORD = "your-db-password"
     DB_NAME = "your-db-name"

     # API Keys
     DEEPSEEK_API_KEY = "your-deepseek-api-key"
     ```

## Security Notes

- Passwords are stored with salted SHA-256 hashing
- Connection strings and API keys are stored in Streamlit secrets
- Role-based permissions prevent unauthorized access to features
- SQL Assistant has safeguards against destructive operations

## Usage Guide

### First-Time Setup

1. An administrator should:
   - Create initial user accounts for club members
   - Set up equipment types, rounds, and other reference data
   - Assign recorder privileges to designated users

2. Recorders can then:
   - Add archer profiles for club members
   - Set up competitions
   - Approve practice scores

3. All archers can:
   - Log in and view their personal dashboard
   - Record practice scores
   - View competition results

### Typical Workflows

**Recording Practice Scores:**
1. Archer logs in and navigates to "Record Score"
2. Enters score details and submits
3. Recorder reviews and approves the score
4. Score appears in archer's performance history

**Setting Up Competitions:**
1. Recorder creates a new competition with dates and rounds
2. System automatically determines eligible archers
3. After the competition, recorder generates results
4. Results are published for all users to view
